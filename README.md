# BART-Project
# 🚉 BART Ridership Analysis and Predictions 📊

## 📜 Introduction

This project aims to analyze and predict BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) ridership patterns based on historical data. By exploring key questions and utilizing data science techniques, we can uncover trends, optimize commuting times, and predict future ridership.

### Key Questions:
- **Busiest BART Station?** 🏙️
- **Least Popular BART Route?** 🚉
- **Best Time to Find a Seat from Berkeley to SF?** ⏰
- **Busiest Day of the Week?** 📅
- **Late-night Ridership Numbers?** 🌙

### Data Science Tasks:
- **Compute Straight-Line Distances Between Stations** ✏️
- **Use the Haversine Formula for Distance Calculation** 🌍
- **Predict Work Commutes Between Stations** 🚆

### Data Preparation Tasks:
- **Combine 2016 and 2017 Ridership Files** 📂
- **Merge Station Data for Enriched Analysis** 🔗
